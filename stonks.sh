#    1. Repeatedly prompts the user for $STOCK, $MONTH, and $YEAR
#       and produces a file containing the adjusted daily closing
#       price for each trading day that month
#    2. The output should be a file named: '<stockSymbol>_<Month>_<Year>.txt'
#    3. The output should be two columns: "Date" and "Adjusted Closing Price / cent"
#       and the output should be in reverse chronological order.
